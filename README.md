# ExpenseTracker
Introduction Project
The Money Tracker project is a user-friendly application designed to help individuals efficiently manage their daily expenses and income. It solves the common problem of losing track of where money is spent by offering a digital solution that eliminates the need for manual record-keeping in diaries or notebooks. The app allows users to log transactions, categorize expenses, and generate detailed reports on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. With intuitive graphical representations, users can easily monitor their cash flow, set spending limits, and work towards saving money. Ultimately, Money Tracker promotes better financial awareness and helps users make informed decisions about their finances.
